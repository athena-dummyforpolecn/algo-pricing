 Scenario: Algorithmic Collusion in Metro Manila During Rush Hour  

 Location: Metro Manila  
 Event: Friday Evening Rush Hour (6:00 PM – 9:00 PM)  
 Key Players:  
1. Grab (dominant player in PH ride-hailing)  
2. JoyRide (competes in TNVS and motorcycle taxis)  
3. Angkas (motorcycle taxi service)  

 How Algorithmic Collusion Happens:  

 Step 1: Normal Pricing Before Rush Hour  
- At 5:30 PM, fares for a Makati to Quezon City ride are:  
- Grab: ₱300  
- JoyRide: ₱280  
- Angkas: ₱250 (motorcycle taxi)  
- Algorithms are independent but track competitor fares.  

 Step 2: Demand Increases Due to Rush Hour  
- At 6:00 PM, demand spikes as commuters leave work.  
- Ride-hailing platforms increase surge pricing based on demand.  
- Grab raises its fare to ₱400.  

 Step 3: Competitor Algorithms React  
- JoyRide's AI detects Grab's price increase and automatically adjusts fares to match.  
- Angkas also raises fares, despite having more available motorcycles.  
- By 6:30 PM, fares for the same Makati-Quezon City trip are:  
  - Grab: ₱450  
  - JoyRide: ₱440  
  - Angkas: ₱430  

 Step 4: Prices Stabilize at a High Level  
- Even though demand fluctuates, prices remain high because:  
- Each platform’s AI expects competitors to keep fares high.  
- Drivers are now used to higher fares and refuse to accept lower-priced bookings.  
- Consumers have no choice but to pay inflated fares.  

 Step 5: Deadweight Loss and Consumer Harm  
- Passengers who would have taken a ride at ₱300 now refuse to book at ₱450.  
- Some opt for jeepneys or buses, increasing congestion and reducing ride-hailing efficiency.  
- Deadweight loss occurs because potential transactions are lost due to artificial price inflation caused by algorithmic mirroring.
